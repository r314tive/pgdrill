# Compatibility And Validation

`pgdrill` is pre-alpha. This document separates build portability, automated
test coverage, and real-environment validation so a green unit test is not
mistaken for a production support claim.

## Release Platforms

The release pipeline builds static `CGO_ENABLED=0` CLI archives for:

- Linux amd64 and arm64
- macOS amd64 and arm64

Windows cross-compilation currently succeeds, but Windows runtime behavior and
the required PostgreSQL backup tools have not been field-tested. Windows
archives are therefore not published.

## Adapter Confidence

WAL-G, Barman, pgBackRest, and pg_probackup catalog parsers have fixture-driven
tests. Restore planning and provider checks have command-construction and
evidence tests. These tests prove normalization against the committed fixtures;
they do not prove compatibility with every historical or future native tool
version.

Before claiming a native version as validated:

1. capture `pgdrill version` and `pgdrill doctor -f <config> -format json`
2. run catalog discovery against a disposable or read-only repository
3. run the provider check profile used in production
4. complete a real restore and the required probes
5. retain the JSON report with secrets redacted

Add new output shapes as sanitized fixtures when they change parser behavior.

`pgdrill doctor` proves that the config is structurally valid for its target,
that each required executable starts, and that its bounded version command
succeeds. It deliberately does not access repositories, database servers, or
the Kubernetes API and therefore does not replace catalog discovery, provider
checks, or a restore drill.

Timestamp PITR configuration is provider-neutral and must use RFC3339 with an
explicit timezone. The selector requires a known backup finish time earlier
than the target, following PostgreSQL's rule that a recovery stop point must be
after the end of the base backup. This filter does not establish WAL archive
continuity; retain the provider check and completed restore evidence.

## Restore Targets

The local target is covered by process, filesystem-boundary, cleanup, and probe
tests using controlled executables. Real PostgreSQL startup and provider
repositories still require environment-specific validation.

The CNPG target has manifest, discovery, lifecycle, failure, evidence, and CLI
tests behind a `kubectl` compatibility client. A disposable live-cluster drill
is still required before describing the target as production-ready. CNPG
operator and PostgreSQL version compatibility is not yet a published matrix.

## PostgreSQL Versions

`pgdrill` does not currently publish a blanket PostgreSQL major-version support
range. Local drills execute the configured PostgreSQL binaries. CNPG drills
reuse the source cluster image, including fallback discovery from its
`postgres` container, to avoid silently changing the PostgreSQL major version.
